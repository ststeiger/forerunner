ForerunnerSDK

After you have installed the ForerunnerSDK package you will need to
configure the settings. A Package Manager Console command has been
supplied to make this as easy as possible.

The new command is named Set-FRConfig and you run it  from the
Package Manager console window. "Tools" -> "NuGet Package Manage" ->
"Package Manager Console".

You can run Set-FRConfig as follows:

Set-FRConfig -Verbose

Set-FRConfig will prompt you for any / all input it needs to configure
the Forerunner SDK in your application. If you are interested in more information
